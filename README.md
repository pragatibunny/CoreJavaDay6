1 Write a program to assign the current thread to t1. Change the name of the thread to MyThread. Display the changed name of the thread. Also it should display the current time. Put the thread to sleep for 10 seconds and display the time again. 

 

2 In the previous program remove the try{}catch(){} block surrounding the sleep method and try to execute the code. What is your observation? 

 

3 Write a program to create a class DemoThread1 implementing Runnable interface. In the constructor, create a new thread and start the thread. In run() display a message "running child Thread in loop : " display the value of the counter ranging from 1 to 10. Within the loop put the thread to sleep for 2 seconds. In main create 3 objects of the DemoTread1 and execute the program. 

 

4 Rewrite the earlier program so that, now the class DemoThread1 instead of implementing from Runnable interface, will now extend from Thread class. 

 

5 Write a program to create a class Number  which implements Runnable. Run method displays the multiples of a number accepted as a parameter. In main create three objects - first object should display the multiples of 2, second should display the multiples of 5 and third should display the multiples of 8. Display appropriate message at the beginning and ending of thread. The main thread should wait for the first object to complete. Display the status of threads before the multiples are displayed and after completing the multiples.
